List of main principles of XML markup process in al-Waqa’i’ al-Misriyya




1. <sic> : any strange (anachronistic – the original text could not have that feature) or grammatically incorrect
    
2. organization of an article:
    <div> <header> <p>
        
3. Hijri date is <date when-custom= xxx>
            
4. XML TEI Header
            
5. personal and role names are together but both are marked up also separately
            
6. objectname
            
7. placename – if found we use Geonames or Cairo Gazeteer 
            
8. Standoff for persons – also in Arabic and ALA-LC 
            
9. In XML HEADER: editorial insstructions : ALA-LC transcription, etc
            
10. CREATING A NEW XML DOCUMENT FROM A WM FILE:
- after editing the text in Word
- copy the text into Master <body></body> "some text here"
- SAVE AS : ADD FILNENAME AS YEAR
            
            
11. Ultimately: separate TEI document for persons in Standoffs
